### ToppeCheat (a.k.a ToppeSkid)
A discontinued server-side anticheat developed in ~2016.

I decided to publish this even though it's nothing compared to modern anticheats. This anticheat was developed for a big Finnish server and was also used by a few other servers. It had some decent checks (that worked well back in 2015-2017). The performance of this plugin was quite poor mainly due to the lack of asynchronous routines.

Not the cleanest code because I was quite new to Java and programming.
